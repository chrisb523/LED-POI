# LED-project
This is a project that can convert relatively small images for use on POI with arduino based operating systems. Additionally, it contains the documentation necessescary to create POI with your own materials, and the difficulties I found along the way. 

# Running and Compiling the Program:

First begin by placing the desired image, titled convert.jpg into the program directory

Then, execute the run.bat file in the program directory

Examine the arduino code file, and ensure that are variables are set correctly 

  -Make sure the Pinout is correct
  
  -Make sure the numleds is correct
